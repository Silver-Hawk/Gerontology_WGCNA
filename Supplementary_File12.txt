GO_SYNAPSE	1171	The junction between a nerve fiber of one neuron and another neuron, muscle fiber or glial cell. As the nerve fiber approaches the synapse it enlarges into a specialized structure, the presynaptic nerve ending, which contains mitochondria and synaptic vesicles. At the tip of the nerve ending is the presynaptic membrane; facing it, and separated from it by a minute cleft (the synaptic cleft) is a specialized area of membrane on the receiving cell, known as the postsynaptic membrane. In response to the arrival of nerve impulses, the presynaptic nerve ending secretes molecules of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. These diffuse across the cleft and transmit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane. [ISBN:0198506732]	152	0.1298	1.59E-52	7.97E-50

GO_GOLGI_APPARATUS	1552	A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack.

In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions.

Functions in the regulation of cell polarity, tissue integrity and intercellular adhesion and permeability. [GOC:go_curators, GOC:kmv, PMID:12525486, PMID:15196556]	15	0.1049	3.45E-5	3.84E-4
GO_TIGHT_JUNCTION	128	A cell-cell junction that seals cells together in an epithelium in a way that prevents even small molecules from leaking from one side of the sheet to the other. [ISBN:0815332181]	14	0.1094	3.92E-5	4.32E-4
GO_SCHAFFER_COLLATERAL__CA1_SYNAPSE	82	A synapse between the Schaffer collateral axon of a CA3 pyramidal cell and a CA1 pyramidal cell. [PMID:16399689]	11	0.1341	3.99E-5	4.34E-4
GO_VOLTAGE_GATED_CALCIUM_CHANNEL_COMPLEX	43	A protein complex that forms a transmembrane channel through which calcium ions may pass in response to changes in membrane potential. [GOC:mah]	8	0.1860	4.16E-5	4.48E-4
GO_HIPPOCAMPAL_MOSSY_FIBER_TO_CA3_SYNAPSE	32	One of the giant synapses that form between the mossy fiber axons of dentate gyrus granule cells and the large complex spines of CA3 pyramidal cells. It consists of a giant bouton known as the mossy fiber expansion, synapsed to the complex, multiheaded spine (thorny excresence) of a CA3 pyramidal cell.

GO_MICROTUBULE	410	Any of the long, generally straight, hollow tubes of internal diameter 12-15 nm and external diameter 24 nm found in a wide variety of eukaryotic cells; each consists (usually) of 13 protofilaments of polymeric tubulin, staggered in such a manner that the tubulin monomers are arranged in a helical pattern on the microtubular surface, and with the alpha/beta axes of the tubulin subunits parallel to the long axis of the tubule; exist in equilibrium with pool of tubulin monomers and can be rapidly assembled or disassembled in response to physiological stimuli; concerned with force generation, e.g. in the spindle.

GO_DENDRITIC_SHAFT	35	Cylindric portion of the dendrite, directly stemming from the perikaryon, and carrying the dendritic spines. [GOC:nln]	7	0.2000	7.77E-5	7.86E-4
GO_ENDOPLASMIC_RETICULUM_PART	1350	Any constituent part of the endoplasmic reticulum, the irregular network of unit membranes, visible only by electron microscopy, that occurs in the cytoplasm of many eukaryotic cells. The membranes form a complex meshwork of tubular channels, which are often expanded into slitlike cavities called cisternae. [GOC:jl]	67	0.0496	8.02E-5	8.03E-4
