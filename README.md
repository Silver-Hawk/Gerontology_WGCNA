This repository contains the supplementary materials for "Weighted gene co-regulation network analysis (WGCNA) of promoter DNA methylation on all-cause mortality in old-aged birth cohorts finds modules of high-risk associated biomarkers".

The paper will be published soon. (link will be added when that happens)

Supplementary File 1: SNP linked CpG probes from the RnBeads R-package.

Supplementary File 2: SNP linked CpG probes from DbSNP.

Supplementary File 3: Gene survival analysis results from both LBC1921 and LBC1936. Additionally, this list also contains modules and connectivity for each gene.

Supplementary File 4: Hub-gene test for the black module in LBC1936.

Supplementary File 5: Hub-gene test for the yellow module in LBC1936.

Supplementary File 6: Box-plot analysis to find genesâ€™ connectivity outside the range of what is expected. We deemed this to be above the third quantile (Q3) + 3 * IQR.

Supplementary File 7: BP GO terms for the black module.

Supplementary File 8: MF GO terms for the black module.

Supplementary File 9: CC GO terms for the black module.

Supplementary File 10: BP GO terms for the yellow module.

Supplementary File 11: MF GO terms for the yellow module.

Supplementary File 12: CC GO terms for the yellow module.
